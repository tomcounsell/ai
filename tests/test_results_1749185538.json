For immediate focus, we have two highest priority items that are ready:\n   - Fix evaluation questions wording\n   - Delete Analysis button implementation\n\nThe good news is these are pretty contained tasks, and we can tackle them one at a time. Since you're dealing with the JWT issues, would you like me to take on one of these other tasks to help distribute the load? Also, maybe we should schedule a quick architecture discussion about the JWT implementation to make sure we're taking the right approach with the refresh tokens.\n\nWant me to grab one of these tasks so you can focus on the auth stuff?
