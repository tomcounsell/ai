Let me explain the optimal implementation strategy:\n\nRefresh tokens solve the token expiration issue by providing a secure way to obtain new access tokens without requiring re-authentication. Here's how we should structure it:\n\n1. Keep your access tokens short-lived (15-30 minutes) for security\n2. Issue a longer-lived refresh token alongside the access token\n3. When the access token expires, the client uses the refresh token to get a new pair\n4. Include token rotation - each refresh generates a new refresh token too\n\nThe key security considerations are:\n- Store refresh tokens securely (hashed in database)\n- Implement proper invalidation on logout/security events\n- Use secure HTTP-only cookies for refresh tokens\n- Add rate limiting on the refresh endpoint\n\nWould you like me to start implementing this solution in your codebase? Just let me know which project we're working in and I can set it up following these best practices.",
