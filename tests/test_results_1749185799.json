The \"Delete Analysis\" button implementation\n3. The \"Low Score Alerts\" feature for health professionals\n\nHere's what I'd suggest:\n- Let's tackle these one at a time - start with testing the evaluation questions fix since it's already ready for review\n- For the JWT issues you mentioned earlier, we can integrate refresh tokens while implementing the Low Score Alerts feature since they'll share authentication infrastructure\n- Everything else can wait - don't worry about the lower priority items for now\n\nWould you like me to help you get started with testing the evaluation questions fix? Or would you prefer to focus on one of the other high-priority items? Sometimes breaking things down into smaller chunks makes it feel more manageable.\n\nAlso, I know from our recent chat that you've been dealing with authentication issues - we can definitely prioritize fixing those if they're blocking your progress.
