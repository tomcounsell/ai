It improves security by allowing shorter lifetimes for access tokens while maintaining user sessions\n2. Provides better user experience by avoiding frequent re-logins\n3. Allows token revocation if needed\n\nThe implementation should include:\n- Generate longer-lived refresh tokens alongside access tokens\n- Store refresh tokens securely (usually in a database)\n- Create a /refresh endpoint to exchange refresh tokens for new access tokens\n- Implement token rotation (invalidate old refresh tokens when used)\n- Add proper expiration handling and error responses\n\nWould you like me to help implement this in your specific codebase?
