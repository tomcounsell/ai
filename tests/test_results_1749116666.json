Start with just the token expiration configuration, then move on to error handling, and finally implement refresh tokens.\n\nI can help you tackle these tasks one at a time - which part would you like to start with? The token expiration configuration would be the most straightforward first step.\n\nThe Delete Analysis button task I was working on can wait until we've stabilized the authentication system.
