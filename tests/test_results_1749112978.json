Here's why and how:\n\n1. Access tokens should have short lifetimes (15-30 minutes) for security\n2. Refresh tokens can live longer (days/weeks) and safely get new access tokens\n3. This way users stay logged in but with frequently rotated credentials\n\nLet's discuss the key implementation points you'll need:\n\n1. Create two token types:\n   - Short-lived access token (JWT)\n   - Longer-lived refresh token (secure random token)\n\n2. Add these endpoints:\n   - `/auth/token` - Initial login returns both tokens\n   - `/auth/refresh` - Use refresh token to get new access token\n   - `/auth/revoke` - Invalidate refresh tokens\n\n3. Security considerations:\n   - Store refresh tokens securely (hashed in database)\n   - Implement token rotation (new refresh token with each use)\n   - Add revocation capability for compromised tokens\n\nWould you like me to walk through any of these aspects in more detail? I can also help with the specific implementation once we get the workspace issues sorted out.",
