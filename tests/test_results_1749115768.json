When the access token expires, the client uses the refresh token to get a new access token without requiring re-login\n3. Implement proper security measures like:\n   - Secure storage of refresh tokens\n   - One-time use (invalidate after refresh)\n   - Ability to revoke refresh tokens\n   - Rate limiting on refresh attempts\n\nCould you let me know which codebase you're working in?
