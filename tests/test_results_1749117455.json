Create refresh token table\nrefresh_tokens = {\n    'id': 'uuid',\n    'user_id': 'foreign_key',\n    'token': 'hashed_token',\n    'expires_at': 'timestamp',\n    'used': 'boolean'\n}\n\n# 2. Update your authentication flow\ndef login():\n    access_token = create_access_token(expires=timedelta(minutes=15))\n    refresh_token = create_refresh_token(expires=timedelta(days=7))\n    store_refresh_token(refresh_token)\n    return {'access': access_token, 'refresh': refresh_token}\n\n# 3. Add refresh endpoint\ndef refresh():\n    validate_refresh_token()\n    invalidate_old_token()\n    new_access = create_access_token()\n    new_refresh = create_refresh_token()\n    store_refresh_token(new_refresh)\n    return {'access': new_access, 'refresh': new_refresh}\n```\n\n4. **Security Considerations**:\n- Implement proper token hashing before storage\n- Add reuse detection logic\n- Include proper error handling\n- Add token revocation capabilities\n\nWould you like me to continue attempting to implement these changes, or would you prefer more specific guidance on any of these aspects?
