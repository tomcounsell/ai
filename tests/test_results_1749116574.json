Revoke access if needed by invalidating refresh tokens\n4. Reduce authentication requests compared to just short-lived JWTs\n\nThe standard flow would be:\n- User logs in \u2192 receives access token + refresh token\n- Access token expires \u2192 use refresh token to get new access token\n- Refresh token has longer expiry but can be revoked if needed\n\nWould you like me to implement this refresh token system for you?

Are you seeing any error messages in the console?\n\nThis will help me fix the issue more effectively on the next attempt.",
