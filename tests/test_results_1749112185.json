Store refresh tokens securely in your database with user association\n3. Create a /refresh endpoint that accepts the refresh token and returns a new access token\n4. On the client side, when the access token expires, use the refresh token to get a new one\n5. Implement token rotation - each refresh generates a new refresh token too\n\nWould you like me to try implementing this again, or would you prefer more specific details about any of these components?",
