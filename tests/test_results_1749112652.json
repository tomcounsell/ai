When the access token expires, the client uses the refresh token to get a new one\n4. This gives us both security (short-lived access) and convenience (no frequent logins)\n\nBefore I implement this, I need to know:\n1. Which authentication library are you currently using?\n2. Where are you storing user data now (database type)?\n3. What's your current access token expiration time?\n\nThis will help me implement the refresh token system in a way that integrates properly with your existing setup.
