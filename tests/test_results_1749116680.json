Access Token (short-lived, 15-60 minutes):\n   - Used for API requests\n   - Contains user claims\n   - Short expiration reduces security risk\n\n2. Refresh Token (longer-lived, days/weeks):\n   - Stored securely (hashed) in database\n   - Used only to get new access tokens\n   - One-time use (rotated on refresh)\n\n3. Key endpoints needed:\n   - `/auth/login` - Returns both access + refresh tokens\n   - `/auth/refresh` - Exchange refresh token for new access token\n   - `/auth/revoke` - Invalidate refresh tokens\n\nWould you like me to implement this in your codebase?
