Token Revocation: Easier to revoke user sessions if needed\n\nOnce the development tools are back online, I can help implement this with:\n- Access tokens valid for 15 minutes\n- Refresh tokens valid for 7 days\n- Secure token rotation\n- Proper database storage for refresh tokens\n\nWould you like me to try implementing this solution again when the tools are back up?
