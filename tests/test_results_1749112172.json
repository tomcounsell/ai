When the access token expires, client uses refresh token to get a new access token\n3. Implement token rotation - each refresh generates a new refresh token too\n4. Store refresh tokens securely (hashed in DB) with user/device info\n\nWould you like me to try implementing this again? I can break it down into smaller steps to avoid the execution error.
