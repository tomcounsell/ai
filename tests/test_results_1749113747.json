Gives you the ability to invalidate sessions server-side if needed\n\nThe implementation would involve:\n- Short-lived JWT access tokens (15-30 minutes)\n- Longer-lived refresh tokens (days/weeks) stored securely\n- Token rotation on refresh for security\n- New endpoints to handle refresh flows\n\nWould you like me to implement this?
