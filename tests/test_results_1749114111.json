Let me know if you need anything else as you continue working on it. Sometimes React rendering issues can be tricky, but we'll figure it out.\n\nI notice you had mentioned feeling overwhelmed earlier. If you want, I can query our project priorities to help focus on what's most important right now - just let me know if you'd like me to check what should be prioritized.",
