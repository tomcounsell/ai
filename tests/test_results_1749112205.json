That would help me give you more targeted guidance on fixing the rendering problem.\n\nSome common areas we should check:\n- Component return statement\n- Props handling\n- State management\n- Conditional rendering logic\n- Component lifecycle\n\nBut I'll be able to give much more specific help once I see the code you're working with.",
