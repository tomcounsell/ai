It allows us to keep access tokens short-lived (improving security) while maintaining a seamless user experience\n2. Users won't get logged out frequently since the refresh token can silently obtain new access tokens\n3. We can revoke user sessions if needed by invalidating refresh tokens\n\nThe implementation would involve:\n- Adding refresh token generation during login\n- Creating a /refresh endpoint to issue new access tokens\n- Secure storage of refresh tokens (httpOnly cookies)\n- Token rotation for security\n- Rate limiting on the refresh endpoint\n\nWould you like me to try implementing this again?
