There's also a ready-to-test item for evaluation questions wording that needs review.\n\nWant me to help knock out one of these tasks? I'd suggest we start with the Delete Analysis button since it's highest priority and relatively straightforward. This way we can get a quick win and reduce that overwhelming feeling.\n\nFor the JWT work, we can schedule that as a focused task once we clear some of these immediate priorities. Would you like me to take on any of these items to help lighten your load?\n\nRemember, we don't have to solve everything at once.
