""" The amygdala represents a core fear system in the human body, which is involved in the expression of conditioned
fear. Fear is measured by changes in autonomic activity including increased heart rate, increased blood pressure,
as well as in simple reflexes such as flinching or blinking. """

""" Fear extinction is defined as a decline in conditioned fear responses (CRs) following nonreinforced exposure to a
feared conditioned stimulus (CS). ... However, there also is evidence to suggest that extinction is an “unlearning”
process corresponding to depotentiation of potentiated synapses within the amygdala."""
