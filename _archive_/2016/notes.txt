Humans: 10^11 neurons, 10^15 synapses
Rat: 10^8 neurons, 10^12 synapses
Bee: 10^5 neurons, 10^9 synapses

10^3 synapses per neuron
Let's compute space requirements for running a bee-size brain on this laptop, then move to EC2 for larger testing


Scenario Gardens

Living in Analog
================
A being may only receive information about the world and itself via analog-like inputs
Goal: Being learns to replicate it's input to some degree
Step 1A: Define an analog imitation filter or context limiter such as adding white noise to communications
Step 1B: Create a real-life filter for output/input screen-camera, speaker-microphone
Step 2: Feedback being's actions as new inputs so it can learn about how itself works


Conversation
============
Small groups of beings must attempt to communicate with each other.
Goal: create a language or framework on which communication of idea can take place
Step 1: communication can only take place via some limited analog-like medium


Survival of the Fittest
======================
Make beings compete for resources
vDNA randomizer creates diversity of beings
A new being regularly is spawned based on vDNA of healthiest beings
Health must be obtained via food goals.
Cooperation unlocks ability to harvest more food.
Aggression steals food from others.

Goal: beings optimized for risk-taking decision making
