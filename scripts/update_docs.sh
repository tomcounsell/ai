Tasks to perform:
1. **Accuracy Check**: Verify all code references, file paths, function names, and architectural descriptions are current
2. **Cross-Reference Validation**: Ensure all references to other documentation files are correct and up-to-date
3. **Code Alignment**: Update any outdated patterns, examples, or architectural descriptions
4. **Recent Changes Integration**: Incorporate any recent codebase changes that affect this documentation
5. **Consistency**: Ensure terminology and architectural descriptions are consistent across docs

Key areas to focus on:
- File paths and directory structure references
- Function and class names mentioned in the documentation
- Architecture diagrams and system descriptions
- Cross-references to other documentation files
- Code examples and snippets
- API patterns and usage examples
- Recent changes to message handling, dev group logic, and Telegram integration

Please read the current documentation file and then:
1. Identify any outdated or incorrect information
2. Update the content to match the current codebase
3. Fix any broken cross-references to other docs
4. Ensure all examples and code references are accurate
5. Maintain the existing documentation style and structure

Only make changes that are necessary to improve accuracy and currency. Do not change the fundamental structure or purpose of the documentation unless there are significant architectural changes that require it."
