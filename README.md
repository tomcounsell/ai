## installation

To install dependencies:

1. Compile dependencies from base requirements into a single file with resolved versions:
   ```
   uv pip compile requirements/base.txt -o requirements.txt
   ```

2. Create a new Python virtual environment using uv (faster alternative to venv/virtualenv):
   ```
   uv venv
   ```

3. Install all dependencies from the compiled requirements file:
   ```
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
