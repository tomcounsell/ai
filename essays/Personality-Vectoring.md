## Abstract

We propose Personality Vectoring, a novel paradigm in which an individual’s current and aspirational selves are represented as vectors in a high-dimensional semantic space, and Large Language Models (LLMs) guide transformation by “vectoring” the person along the computed delta between these vectors. Drawing on advances in embedding-based personality prediction, narrative psychology, and digital therapeutics, we outline the theoretical foundations, review empirical precedents, expose philosophical tensions, and sketch a voice-based conversational interface for real-time guidance. We conclude by calling for interdisciplinary collaboration to validate and responsibly deploy this approach.

## Introduction

Across psychology, AI, and philosophy, the human aspiration for self-improvement has long been addressed through narrative, therapy, and behavioral interventions. Recent breakthroughs in natural language embeddings now permit us to quantify aspects of personality from text with over 80% accuracy. By embedding self-narratives or assessments into the same vector space as words and documents, we can locate a person’s “current self” vector alongside an “ideal self” vector. The difference between these two points—the delta vector—offers a precise semantic direction for growth. Personality Vectoring asks: can we use LLMs, trained to recognize and apply these delta vectors, as conversational guides that gently steer individuals toward self-defined ideals, all while preserving autonomy and authenticity?

## Embedding Personality and Semantic Trajectories

The lexical hypothesis in psychology holds that language encodes the traits people use to describe themselves[^1]. Transformer-based embeddings (e.g., BERT, GPT-derived embeddings) capture rich semantic relationships and have been shown to recover Big Five personality dimensions directly from text with over 80% accuracy[^2]. To vectorize personality, one embeds a person’s self-description or journal entries into a high-dimensional space. An aspirational narrative—such as “I speak up confidently in group settings”—is similarly embedded. Subtracting the current-self vector from the ideal-self vector yields a transformation vector that encodes the semantic changes needed to move from one state to the other.

Experiments with word embeddings established that semantic analogies (e.g., “king”–“man”+“woman”≈“queen”) reflect consistent directions. Early trials show that linear interpolation along transformation vectors produces coherent intermediate profiles, and that the cosine similarity between intended and realized personality shifts can exceed 0.8. Moreover, by embedding time-stamped journal entries, researchers have tracked semantic drift—observing, for instance, how therapy or life events shift someone’s language closer to vectors representing “emotional stability” or “openness.”

## Psychological and Therapeutic Foundations

Psychological theories of both trait and narrative identity naturally complement vectorized modeling. Big Five trait theory provides stable axes (e.g., extraversion, agreeableness) that can be projected from text embeddings. Narrative identity theory views personal growth as the ongoing construction of one’s life story; writing exercises like the “Best Possible Self” already harness the motivational power of articulating an ideal future. Internal Family Systems (IFS) therapy further suggests that identity comprises multiple “parts”—sub-vectors that may each require different guidance before reconciling at a balanced core Self.

Clinical studies reinforce the potential for meaningful change. Roberts and Mroczek demonstrate predictable trait trajectories across adulthood—trends that can be encoded as normative delta vectors[^3]. Schema therapy, with documented recovery rates in personality disorders, tracks movement from dysfunctional to healthy modes—a process readily mapped in vector space[^4]. These precedents affirm that language-based interventions can produce lasting transformation when carefully validated.

## Philosophical and Ethical Considerations

Reducing identity to vectors unavoidably raises philosophical tensions. Derek Parfit’s notion that persons are no more than their psychological constituents supports the feasibility of computational modeling. Yet narrative philosophers remind us that identity is irreducibly interpretive: the meanings we ascribe to our experiences cannot be fully captured by numbers. Authenticity demands that any “ideal” vector be self-defined and mutable; autonomy requires the individual to lead the process, with the AI serving as compass, not commander.

Ethically, Personality Vectoring must guard against “data fetishism”—the temptation to privilege quantitative measures over lived experience—and ensure informed consent, transparency about the AI’s role, and robust privacy protections. Users must retain control to pause or modify their goals, and systems should escalate to human professionals when complex psychological needs emerge.

## Voice-Based Conversational Interface

To bring Personality Vectoring into daily life, we propose a voice-based interface that runs over standard phone lines:
	1.	Baseline Assessment: A natural dialogue infers the user’s current-self vector from speech patterns, lexical choices, and narrative themes, without requiring explicit questionnaires.
	2.	Goal Articulation: The user describes desired qualities and life contexts; this aspirational narrative is embedded to form the target vector.
	3.	Delta Computation: The system calculates the transformation vector and parameterizes conversational prompts accordingly.
	4.	Conversational Vectoring: A fine-tuned LLM uses the delta vector to select questions, reflections, and topic transitions that encourage movement toward the goal state.
	5.	Continuous Calibration: Each user response is re-embedded in real time; progress is measured by shifts in cosine similarity, and the AI adapts its guidance pace and content.

Advantages of voice over text include accessibility (no app install), intimacy (promoting deeper self-disclosure), and authenticity (capturing spontaneous vocal cues). By embedding conversational snippets rather than static text, the system can detect subtle shifts in tone and content, enabling more sensitive guidance.

## Call for Collaborative Research and Development

Personality Vectoring stands at an interdisciplinary frontier. To advance this concept from white paper to real-world tool, we invite collaboration on:
	•	Validation Studies: Conduct within-subject pilots (10–15 participants) measuring semantic vector shifts alongside standard psychometric and behavioral measures.
	•	Technical Toolkits: Develop and open-source libraries for personality embedding, delta computation, and conversational steering modules.
	•	Ethical Frameworks: Assemble interdisciplinary teams—psychologists, AI researchers, ethicists—to draft guidelines ensuring respect for autonomy, authenticity, and privacy.
	•	Clinical Partnerships: Pilot voice-based vectoring as an adjunct to therapy or digital therapeutics, assessing both engagement metrics and mental-health outcomes.

By synthesizing computational rigor with narrative depth and ethical integrity, Personality Vectoring offers a path toward human-AI collaboration that honors the complexity of identity. We call on researchers, clinicians, and technologists to join us in refining, testing, and responsibly deploying these ideas—so that AI may serve as a semantic compass, guiding individuals not to some externally defined ideal, but toward their own authentic horizons.
