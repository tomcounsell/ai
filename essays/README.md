## Abstract

This collection presents research essays exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and human-computer interaction. The works focus on novel approaches to AI-assisted personal development, advanced context management in large language models, and computational models of personality and identity transformation.

## Table of Contents

### [Personality Vectoring](./Personality-Vectoring.md)
*Published: 2025*

A foundational exploration of using Large Language Models to guide personal transformation by representing current and aspirational selves as vectors in semantic space. This paper outlines theoretical foundations from psychology and AI, reviews empirical precedents, and proposes a voice-based conversational interface for real-time guidance toward self-defined growth objectives.

**Keywords:** *personality psychology, semantic vectors, LLMs, personal development, computational psychology*

### [Personality Vectoring: Psychological Foundations](./Personality-Vectoring-Psy-Notes.md)
*Published: 2025*

Comprehensive analysis examining Personality Vectoring from a clinical psychology perspective. Includes theoretical alignment with Big Five personality traits, narrative identity theory, methodological approaches for implementation, empirical evidence from related fields, and ethical considerations for therapeutic applications.

**Keywords:** *clinical psychology, Big Five traits, narrative identity, digital therapeutics, ethics*

### [Vectorized Identity and Personality Drift: Research Foundation](./Vectorized-Identity-Research.md)
*Published: 2025*

In-depth research paper exploring theoretical and empirical foundations for representing human personality and identity as navigable vectors in high-dimensional semantic space. Presents experimental approaches, interdisciplinary perspectives, collaborative research frameworks, and extensive bibliography spanning psychology, philosophy, and artificial intelligence.

**Keywords:** *computational identity, semantic spaces, interdisciplinary research, experimental psychology, AI ethics*

### [Context is King: Long Live Context](./Context-is-King.md)
*Published: 2025*

Technical white paper examining advanced approaches to context length extension and long-term memory systems in Large Language Models. Reviews recent innovations including cascading KV caches, infinite retrieval mechanisms, and episodic memory architectures that enable LLMs to maintain persistent context across extended interactions.

**Keywords:** *LLM architecture, context windows, episodic memory, attention mechanisms, long-term AI systems*

## Research Themes

The essays in this collection explore several interconnected themes:

- **Computational Models of Identity**: Novel approaches to representing and manipulating personal identity using AI systems
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Frameworks for AI systems that enhance rather than replace human cognitive processes  
- **Long-term Learning Systems**: Technical approaches to building AI that accumulates knowledge and maintains continuity over time
- **Ethical AI Development**: Considerations for developing AI systems that respect human autonomy and authenticity
