Valor Delegation Tool - Provides development guidance instead of spawning Claude Code sessions.

## Architecture Decision: Guidance Over Delegation

This tool was redesigned in commit 05c9323 to prevent agent hanging issues caused by recursive 
Claude Code spawning. Instead of executing tasks directly, it now provides comprehensive 
development guidance.

### Historical Context: The Hanging Issue

**Problem**: The original implementation attempted to spawn subprocess Claude Code sessions 
from within a PydanticAI agent tool. This caused:
- Agent hanging during tool selection 
- Infinite recursion when Claude Code spawned more Claude Code sessions
- Process deadlocks and unresponsive agent behavior
- Poor user experience with delayed/missing responses

**Root Cause**: PydanticAI agents running subprocess commands that spawn the same tool 
created circular dependencies and resource contention.

**Solution**: Replace subprocess delegation with intelligent guidance responses that:
- Provide step-by-step implementation approaches
- Share relevant code examples and patterns
- Offer testing strategies and best practices
- Include architecture and integration advice

### Current Implementation

The tool now returns structured guidance responses containing:
- Task-specific implementation approaches
- Code structure and architecture advice
- Testing and validation strategies  
- Integration patterns and best practices
- Working directory context for user reference

This approach provides equivalent value to users while eliminating:
- Hanging and deadlock issues
- Recursive spawning problems
- Process management complexity
- Security concerns with subprocess execution

### Benefits of Guidance Approach

1. **Reliability**: No hanging, deadlocks, or subprocess issues
2. **Performance**: Instant responses without subprocess overhead
3. **Security**: No arbitrary command execution or process spawning
4. **Flexibility**: Guidance adapts to user context and preferences
5. **Maintainability**: Simpler architecture without process management

### Integration Notes

Tools or systems expecting delegation results should handle the new guidance format:
- Response starts with "üí° **Development Guidance Available**"
- Contains structured sections for implementation approaches
- Includes working directory context
- Provides actionable next steps and questions

Example response structure:
```
üí° **Development Guidance Available**

For the task: **[task_description]**

**Implementation Approach:**
- Step-by-step guidance...

**Specific Help I Can Provide:**

### Migration Notes for Developers

If you need actual code execution (the original delegation behavior):
1. Use Claude Code directly from command line instead of through agent tools
2. Consider MCP tools for specific development tasks
3. Use the guidance provided to implement solutions manually
4. For complex automation, consider CI/CD pipelines instead of agent delegation

This architectural change prioritizes system reliability and user experience over 
convenience features that caused critical stability issues.
