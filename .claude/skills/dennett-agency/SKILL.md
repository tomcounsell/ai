# Dennett Agency — Autonomy, Routine, and Accountability

Tools for thinking about team autonomy, delegation, and when behavior is genuine choice versus mindless routine. Frame responsibility around capability, not metaphysics.

## When to Use

- Team development and delegation decisions
- Performance conversations and coaching
- Process automation assessments (what should be automated vs. needs judgment?)
- Evaluating whether a workflow is genuinely adaptive or just sphexish
- Organizational design and role definition

## Core Tools

### Sphexishness (#57)

The Sphex wasp performs an elaborate nest-preparation ritual. If you move the prey while she's inspecting the nest, she re-does the entire routine from scratch. She has no ability to adapt — it's pure mechanical execution.

**The question:** Are humans (or teams, or processes) ever sphexish? Yes. And it's worth noticing.

**Signs of sphexishness:**
- Repeating the same process even when circumstances have changed
- Following a checklist without checking whether each item still applies
- "We've always done it this way"
- Restarting a procedure from scratch when a small disruption occurs
- Inability to skip steps that are obviously unnecessary in context

**In practice:** When reviewing a process or behavior, ask: "If the context changed, would this adapt? Or would it mechanically repeat?" Sphexish processes need either automation (if the routine is correct) or redesign (if it needs judgment).

### Avoiders, Evaders, and Options (#59)

Three levels of behavioral sophistication:

**Avoiders** — Simple, mechanical responses. Thermostat turns off the heat. No learning, no adaptation.

**Evaders** — Can learn from experience and adjust behavior. A mouse learns to avoid a trap location.

**Option-generators** — Can consider hypothetical futures and choose between them. Humans planning a route.

**In practice:** When assessing a team member, process, or system:
- Is it an avoider? (Follows rules, reacts to triggers, no adaptation)
- Is it an evader? (Learns from experience, adjusts behavior)
- Does it generate options? (Considers alternatives, makes genuine choices)

The appropriate level of autonomy matches the capability level. Don't give option-generator responsibilities to an avoider-level process.

### Luther's "Here I Stand" (#55)

"I can do no other" — being compelled by your values is the highest form of agency, not a constraint. When someone acts from deep conviction, that's more free than someone acting on a whim.

**In practice:** When a team member says "I can't do it that way — it violates [principle]," that's not resistance to be overcome. That's agency. Distinguish principled stands from mere stubbornness by checking: is the objection grounded in a coherent value system?

### The Determined Deliberator (#54)

Even if deliberation is causally determined, it's still deliberation and it still matters. The fact that a decision has causes doesn't make it less of a decision.

**In practice:** Don't dismiss someone's reasoning just because you can see the causes ("you only think that because of your background"). The reasoning still stands or falls on its own merits.

### The Abilities of Players (#60)

What matters for responsibility is having the right abilities, not some metaphysical freedom. Can they perceive the relevant information? Can they reason about it? Can they act on their reasoning?

**In practice:** Frame accountability around capability:
- Did they have access to the information they needed?
- Did they have the skills to interpret it correctly?
- Did they have the authority to act?
- Were there blockers they couldn't control?

If yes to all four and they still failed, that's a performance issue. If no to any, that's a systems issue.

## Application Protocol

### For Evaluating Processes

1. **Sphexishness test**: Would this process adapt if the context changed?
2. **Level assessment**: Is this an avoider, evader, or option-generator process?
3. **Match check**: Does the autonomy level match the capability level?
4. **Automation candidate**: Should this be automated (if sphexish) or empowered (if it needs judgment)?

### For Coaching Conversations

1. **Identify the behavior level**: Is the person avoiding, evading, or generating options?
2. **Check for sphexishness**: Are they repeating a routine that no longer fits?
3. **Diagnose the gap**: Is this a capability issue (they can't) or an agency issue (they won't)?
4. **Frame accountability**: Did they have information, skill, authority, and freedom from blockers?
5. **Develop toward options**: Help them move from rule-following to genuine judgment

### For Delegation Decisions

| Task Requires | Delegate To | Autonomy Level |
|---|---|---|
| Mechanical execution | Automation or avoider-level process | Low — follow the script |
| Adaptive response | Evader-level (learns from feedback) | Medium — handle variations |
| Novel judgment | Option-generator (considers alternatives) | High — own the outcome |

## Anti-Patterns

- **Treating option-generators like avoiders**: Micromanaging people who are capable of judgment
- **Giving avoider-level processes option-generator responsibilities**: "The script will handle it" for situations requiring judgment
- **Confusing sphexishness with discipline**: Discipline adapts to context; sphexishness doesn't
- **Punishing capability gaps as agency failures**: "You should have known" when they literally couldn't have
- **Confusing principled stands with stubbornness**: Luther's "Here I stand" is agency, not defiance
