# Sub-Skill: PR Checkout

Mechanical setup: **mergeability preflight**, then clean git state and checkout the PR branch.

## Context Variables

- `$SDLC_PR_NUMBER` — PR number to checkout (fallback: extract from nudge feedback or `gh pr list`)
- `$SDLC_PR_BRANCH` — expected branch name (informational)

## Mergeability Preflight (runs BEFORE any diff reading)

**Why:** Three consecutive `/do-pr-review` passes once APPROVED PR #1100 while
`mergeable=CONFLICTING` and `mergeStateStatus=DIRTY`. No amount of subjective
code-review quality matters if the branch cannot mechanically merge. This
preflight is cheap (single `gh pr view` API call, ~200ms) and MUST run before
the checkout, diff, or any Read of PR files.

### Preflight Steps

1. **Resolve PR number first:**
   ```bash
   PR_NUMBER="${SDLC_PR_NUMBER:-}"
   if [ -z "$PR_NUMBER" ]; then
     echo "WARNING: SDLC_PR_NUMBER not set, attempting to detect from context"
     PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr list --state open --limit 1 --json number --jq '.[0].number')
   fi
   ```

2. **Query mergeable state (single API call):**
   ```bash
   PREFLIGHT_JSON=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus,state)
   PR_STATE=$(echo "$PREFLIGHT_JSON" | jq -r '.state')
   PR_MERGEABLE=$(echo "$PREFLIGHT_JSON" | jq -r '.mergeable')
   PR_MERGE_STATUS=$(echo "$PREFLIGHT_JSON" | jq -r '.mergeStateStatus')
   echo "Preflight: state=$PR_STATE mergeable=$PR_MERGEABLE mergeStateStatus=$PR_MERGE_STATUS"
   ```

   Note: GitHub computes `mergeable` asynchronously. On a just-opened PR the
   first query may return `mergeable=UNKNOWN`. If so, retry once after 2s:
   ```bash
   if [ "$PR_MERGEABLE" = "UNKNOWN" ]; then
     sleep 2
     PREFLIGHT_JSON=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus,state)
     PR_STATE=$(echo "$PREFLIGHT_JSON" | jq -r '.state')
     PR_MERGEABLE=$(echo "$PREFLIGHT_JSON" | jq -r '.mergeable')
     PR_MERGE_STATUS=$(echo "$PREFLIGHT_JSON" | jq -r '.mergeStateStatus')
   fi
   ```

3. **Decision table — apply in order, short-circuit on first match:**

   | Condition | Action | Verdict | Proceed? |
   |-----------|--------|---------|----------|
   | `state != "OPEN"` (CLOSED, MERGED) | Emit `PR_CLOSED` verdict, post a short comment noting the PR is not open, skip all further review. | `PR_CLOSED` | NO |
   | `mergeable == "CONFLICTING"` OR `mergeStateStatus == "DIRTY"` | Emit `BLOCKED_ON_CONFLICT` verdict. Post a comment that explicitly cites the `mergeStateStatus` value and asks the author to rebase/resolve. Skip checkout, diff reading, and code review. | `BLOCKED_ON_CONFLICT` | NO |
   | `mergeStateStatus == "BEHIND"` | Note it in the preflight log — the branch is behind base but has no conflicts. Proceed with full code review; the branch will be mergeable once updated. | (informational) | YES |
   | `mergeable == "MERGEABLE"` AND `mergeStateStatus IN ("CLEAN", "HAS_HOOKS", "UNSTABLE", "BLOCKED")` | Normal path — proceed with checkout and full code review. `BLOCKED` here is a GitHub status for missing-required-review/check, which IS what this review is supposed to produce. `UNSTABLE` means non-required checks failed; surface in findings but do not short-circuit. | (informational) | YES |
   | `mergeable == "UNKNOWN"` after retry | Log a warning and proceed conservatively — GitHub may not have finished computing. Do not emit a short-circuit verdict purely on UNKNOWN. | (informational) | YES |

4. **Short-circuit verdict emission (if preflight fails):**

   Use the corresponding verdict template from `post-review.md` (§2c for
   `PR_CLOSED`, §2b for `BLOCKED_ON_CONFLICT`). Post the comment via
   `gh pr comment` (not `gh pr review --request-changes` — a closed PR cannot
   take a review). Then emit the terminal OUTCOME block and exit. Do NOT
   continue to Step 5 below.

5. **Only if preflight passes:** continue to the checkout steps.

## Checkout Steps

1. **Clean git state:**
   ```bash
   python -c "from agent.worktree_manager import ensure_clean_git_state; from pathlib import Path; ensure_clean_git_state(Path('.'))"
   ```

2. **Checkout PR branch:**
   ```bash
   gh pr checkout $PR_NUMBER
   ```

3. **Verify checkout:**
   ```bash
   CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
   echo "Checked out branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"
   ```

## Completion

Report the checked-out branch name and PR number. All subsequent sub-skills
will read files from this branch.
