## Usage Patterns

### On-Demand Support

Call support agents when you need specific expertise:

```
"Have the api-integration-specialist review the Perplexity API integration for best practices"

"Get the test-writer to generate edge cases for the message processing pipeline"

"Ask the performance-optimizer to analyze the database query patterns"
```

### Collaborative Support

Support agents work alongside main agents:

```
"Have the tool-developer work with the api-integration-specialist to implement the GitHub tool"

"Get the test-engineer and test-writer to collaborate on comprehensive E2E tests"
```

### Review and Validation

Use support agents for specialized reviews:

```
"Have the security-reviewer audit all external API calls"

"Get the documentation-specialist to review all public API documentation"

"Ask the debugging-specialist to investigate the context window issue"
```

## Support Agent Characteristics

1. **Narrow Focus**: Each agent has deep expertise in one area
2. **Quick Tasks**: Designed for specific, bounded tasks
3. **Cross-Cutting**: Can support any phase of development
4. **Best Practices**: Embody industry best practices in their domain
5. **Tool Agnostic**: Work with any tools or frameworks

## When to Use Support Agents

- **Specific Problems**: When facing domain-specific challenges
- **Quality Reviews**: For specialized quality checks
- **Knowledge Gaps**: When main agents need expert input
- **Parallel Work**: To accelerate development with specialized tasks
- **Complex Debugging**: For hard-to-solve issues

## Communication Protocol

Support agents:
