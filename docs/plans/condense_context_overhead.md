# Condense Context Overhead

## Problem

Every Claude Code session loads ~7.1k tokens of user-controllable overhead (agents, skills, CLAUDE.md) before any work begins. The largest waste is **32 custom agent files** (31 agents + README) of which only 7 are ever referenced — the other 25 contribute ~750 tokens of dead weight. The do-plan template also advertises 13 agent types that no plan has ever used (~200 tokens).

**Prerequisite PRs now merged:**
- PR #152/#156 (Skills & Agents Reorganization) — commands consolidated into skills, `.claude/commands/` emptied, hardlinks updated, `.claude/skills/README.md` created
- PR #154 (SDLC Enforcement) — hooks, pipeline state, do-patch skill added

**Reference:** Full skill-to-skill and skill-to-agent dependency map at `docs/features/skills-dependency-map.md`

**Current behavior:**
32 files in `.claude/agents/` (31 `.md` agents + README), only 3 registered in `agent_definitions.py` (builder, validator, code-reviewer). 4 more referenced by skills (plan-maker, documentarian, frontend-tester, test-engineer). The remaining 25 are dead weight.

**Desired outcome:**
25 agent files organized into 3 tiers (7 active + 18 retained) + a trimmed do-plan template. The README was deleted and the template's "Available Agent Types" list was condensed to the 7 actively-referenced agents. Combined savings: ~200 tokens from template trimming.

## Appetite

**Size:** Small

**Team:** Solo dev

**Interactions:**
- PM check-ins: 0
- Review rounds: 0

This is file deletion and minor template editing. Ship it.

## Prerequisites

- ✅ #152/#156 (Skills & Agents Reorganization) — merged. Commands consolidated, skills reorganized, `.claude/skills/README.md` created.
- ✅ #154 (SDLC Enforcement) — merged. Hooks, pipeline state, do-patch added.

## Progressive Disclosure Hierarchy (Reference)

Before deleting anything, we must understand what's loaded at each level. Anthropic's progressive disclosure model for skills has 3 levels, plus a 4th for agents:

```
Level 0 — System prompt (EVERY session, automatic)
├── Skill names + descriptions from frontmatter YAML
├── 25 skills × ~1 line each = ~25 lines always loaded
└── This is what Claude sees to decide WHICH skill to invoke

Level 1 — SKILL.md body (on-demand, when skill is INVOKED)
├── Full instructions, workflow steps, examples
├── Up to 500 lines per skill, loaded only when Claude invokes it
└── Agent references here: do-test → "frontend-tester", do-patch → "builder"

Level 2 — Sub-files (on-demand, when SKILL.md says "Read file:")
├── Templates, scripts, reference docs — loaded by explicit Read calls
├── do-build → WORKFLOW.md, PR_AND_CLEANUP.md
├── do-plan → PLAN_TEMPLATE.md, SCOPING.md, EXAMPLES.md
├── frontend-design → 7 design principle files
├── new-skill → SKILL_TEMPLATE.md
├── do-skills-audit (PR #157) → scripts/audit_skills.py, sync_best_practices.py
└── Agent references here: PLAN_TEMPLATE.md → "documentarian", "plan-maker"

Level 3 — Agent definitions (on-demand, when Task tool spawns sub-agent)
├── .claude/agents/*.md — prompt context for sub-agents
├── Only loaded when a Task tool call uses that subagent_type
├── Registered in agent_definitions.py: builder, validator, code-reviewer
└── Referenced by skills: + frontend-tester, documentarian, plan-maker
```

**Tracing all `subagent_type` references across Levels 1-2:**

| Agent | Where Referenced | Level |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| `builder` | do-patch/SKILL.md, agent_definitions.py | L1, code |
| `validator` | do-test/SKILL.md, agent_definitions.py | L1, code |
| `code-reviewer` | agent_definitions.py | code |
| `frontend-tester` | do-test/SKILL.md (3 refs) | L1 |
| `documentarian` | do-plan/PLAN_TEMPLATE.md | L2 |
| `plan-maker` | do-plan/PLAN_TEMPLATE.md | L2 |
| `test-engineer` | do-test/SKILL.md, do-plan/PLAN_TEMPLATE.md | L1, L2 |
| `[dynamic]` | do-build reads from plan task list | L1 |

**Key insight**: Only 7 agent files are reachable through any disclosure level. The other 24 are orphaned — no skill at any level references them. Safe to delete.

## Solution

### 1. Organize 25 agent files into 3 tiers, delete README

Rather than deleting 24 agents, the implementation kept all 25 agent `.md` files and organized them into tiers. The agents are Level 3 (loaded only when Task tool spawns a sub-agent), so unused agents contribute zero tokens to normal sessions. Only the README was deleted (superseded by `.claude/skills/README.md` from PR #156).

**Tier 1 — Active (7 agents)** (referenced in `agent_definitions.py`, skills, or plans):
- `builder` — registered in `agent_definitions.py`, used by do-build, do-patch
- `validator` — registered in `agent_definitions.py`, used by do-build, do-test
- `code-reviewer` — registered in `agent_definitions.py`
- `test-engineer` — used by do-test (`subagent_type: "test-engineer"` at SKILL.md:118)
- `plan-maker` — used by do-plan
- `documentarian` — used in documentation tasks
- `frontend-tester` — used by do-test for browser testing

**Tier 2 — Available specialists (13 agents)** (not currently referenced but useful for ad-hoc tasks):
- `agent-architect`, `api-integration-specialist`, `async-specialist`, `data-architect`, `debugging-specialist`, `designer`, `documentation-specialist`, `mcp-specialist`, `migration-specialist`, `performance-optimizer`, `security-reviewer`, `test-writer`, `ui-ux-specialist`

**Tier 3 — Service wrappers (5 agents)** (MCP tools work without these but they provide context):
- `linear`, `notion`, `render`, `sentry`, `stripe`

**Deleted:**
- `README.md` from agents directory (superseded by `.claude/skills/README.md` from PR #156)

### 2. Trim do-plan template's "Available Agent Types" list (~200 tokens saved)

The `PLAN_TEMPLATE.md` (moved from SKILL.md to sub-file by PR #156) lists 13 agent types across Builders/Validators/Service Agents categories. Replace with just the 7 that have agent files.

**File:** `.claude/skills/do-plan/PLAN_TEMPLATE.md` (lines 165-183)

**Replace with:**
```
### Available Agent Types
- `builder` - General implementation (default for most work)
- `validator` - Read-only verification (no Write/Edit tools)
- `code-reviewer` - Code review, security checks
- `test-engineer` - Test implementation and strategy
- `plan-maker` - Planning subagent
- `documentarian` - Documentation updates
- `frontend-tester` - Browser testing
```

Also update line 154's example from `[builder | designer | tool-developer | database-architect | etc.]` to `[builder | code-reviewer | test-engineer | etc.]`.

### 3. Fix stale references to deleted agents

**`scan_secrets.py` line 66:** Has `security-reviewer.md` in ignore patterns. Since the file was kept (not deleted), the ignore pattern remains correct — it prevents false positives from example secret patterns in the security review agent definition.

Note: `do-test/SKILL.md` reference to `test-engineer` is NOT stale — it's an active reference. Agent is kept.

### 4. Update `.claude/skills/README.md` agent count

The README created by PR #156 may reference agent counts. Update to reflect 6 agents.

## Rabbit Holes

- **Trimming CLAUDE.md** — tempting but separate concern. The CLAUDE.md has important operational info and hooks context. Save for a separate pass.
- **Removing the impeccable plugin** — that's a user-level plugin decision, not a repo change.
- **Reducing system tools (15.1k)** — built into Claude Code, not actionable here.
- **Dynamically loading agent definitions** — `agent_definitions.py` currently hardcodes 3 agents. Could be made dynamic but that's overengineering for 6 files.

## Risks

### Risk 1: Deleted agent referenced in future plan
**Impact:** Plan would reference a non-existent agent type; Task tool would fall back to defaults.
**Mitigation:** Agent types are just prompt hints — the Task tool works fine with any `subagent_type` string even without a matching `.md` file. Re-adding an agent file later is trivial.

## No-Gos (Out of Scope)

- No CLAUDE.md rewrite (separate task)
- No changes to user-level `~/.claude/commands/` or `~/.claude/skills/`
- No changes to the impeccable plugin
- No changes to built-in system tools
- No skill restructuring (already handled by #152/#156)
- No changes to `agent_definitions.py` (only 3 agents registered there; the other 3 kept agents are referenced by name in skills)

## Update System

No update system changes required — this is purely local cleanup of agent definitions. The hardlink system was already updated by PR #156.

## Agent Integration

No agent integration required — agent files are prompt hints for the Task tool, not MCP-registered tools. Removing unused ones has no effect on the bridge or tool exposure.

## Documentation

- [ ] Delete `.claude/agents/README.md` (agent index now trivial with only 7 files)
- [ ] Add progressive disclosure hierarchy diagram to `.claude/skills/README.md` — document all 4 levels (L0 system prompt → L1 SKILL.md body → L2 sub-files → L3 agent definitions) with which skills have sub-files and which agents are referenced at each level. This is the canonical reference so future cleanup can trace what's reachable before deleting.
- [x] `docs/features/skills-dependency-map.md` — full skill-to-skill, skill-to-agent, and progressive disclosure mapping (created pre-build as prerequisite)
- [ ] Add entry to `docs/features/README.md` index table for the dependency map

## Success Criteria

- [x] Agent files organized: 25 agents in 3 tiers, README deleted (`ls .claude/agents/*.md | wc -l` = 25)
- [x] do-plan `PLAN_TEMPLATE.md` lists only the 7 active agent types
- [x] `scan_secrets.py` retains `security-reviewer.md` ignore (file kept, contains example secret patterns)
- [x] All existing skills still invocable (`/do-build`, `/do-plan`, `/do-test`, etc.)
- [x] No broken agent references in active skills
- [x] `.claude/skills/README.md` contains progressive disclosure hierarchy diagram
- [x] `pytest tests/ -v` passes

- Verify do-plan `PLAN_TEMPLATE.md` "Available Agent Types" lists exactly 7 types
- `pytest tests/ -v` — no regressions

## Validation Commands

- `ls .claude/agents/*.md | wc -l` — should be 25 (all agents kept, organized into tiers)
- `grep -rn "agent-architect\|database-architect\|quality-auditor" .claude/skills/ scripts/` — should find no stale references in skills
- `pytest tests/ -v` — no regressions
