## Test Impact

- [ ] `tests/unit/test_recovery_ownership.py::test_owners_are_known_values` — UPDATE: `known_owners` gains `"reflection"`, the owner value for `admitted` (the `improvement-intent-reconcile` reflection). `test_keys_match_non_terminal_statuses` stays as written and is the guard that forces the two edits to land together.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_session_lifecycle_consolidation.py` (non-terminal enumeration at `:407-421`) — UPDATE: the enumerated set gains `admitted` and the count becomes ten.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_ui_sdlc_data.py` — UPDATE: the `ACTIVE_STATUSES` assertion gains `admitted`.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_session_recovery_drip_budget.py` — UPDATE: add one case asserting an `admitted` session is never dripped to `pending` (same shape as the `paused_budget` case at `:96`).
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_improvement_models.py` — UPDATE: the `EVIDENCE_KINDS` assertion gains `resource_acquired`.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_ui_app.py` and the `ui/data/improvement.py` getter-list pin — UPDATE: the exact getter list gains `get_control_status`; the new partial renders with an empty namespace, a seeded paused case, and an unreachable namespace.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_reflection_register.py` — UPDATE: `register_improvement_intent_reconcile` is idempotent, pinned to the `valor` owner, and carries `cadence="300s"`.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_settings.py` — UPDATE: `ImprovementSettings` gains `lease_ttl_seconds=90`, `journal_max_entries=1000`, `max_dispatch_attempts=3`; `IMPROVEMENT__LEASE_TTL_SECONDS` overrides.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_improvement_resources.py` — UPDATE: the vault-write probe row now reads `verified` because `tools/vault_write.py` exists; the test that asserted `absent` flips.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_validate_no_raw_redis_delete.py::test_model_list_is_complete` — no change expected; this lane adds no `popoto.Model` subclass. Listed so the builder runs it after adding `tools/improvement_control/`.
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_infrastructure_budget.py` — no change; unit 3's key and scripts stay where lane 7 put them (see No-Gos).

## No-Gos (Out of Scope)

- [SEPARATE-SLUG #3220] The production session execution lease (`models/redis_lease.py`, `lease:session:{agent_session_id}`, write fencing in `transition_status` and the Telegram relay, the shadow-release flag). This lane consumes a lease through `tools/improvement_control/lease.py::LeaseProtocol`, whose three calls match #3220's declared interface, and ships an interim implementation confined to `improve:*` keys. `tests/unit/test_improvement_control_lease.py::test_interim_lease_retired_when_redis_lease_exists` fails the moment `models/redis_lease.py` exists, so #3220 lands by deleting the interim module and pointing the protocol at its own. This lane opens no change to `agent/agent_session_queue.py`, `agent/session_executor.py`, or `transition_status`.
- [SEPARATE-SLUG #3217] The `improvement-assumption-digest` reflection, the planner tick that opens cases, and the dashboard renderings of cases, hypotheses, and rejected experiments. This lane ships the `resource_acquired` evidence row and `tools/vault_write.py::render_resource_acquired_section(rows)`, the pure renderer the digest calls.
- [SEPARATE-SLUG #3216] The `serves_charter` judge and every file under `tools/improvement_eval/`. This lane's meter exposes `reserve`/`settle` for lane 4's paid evaluators to call; it does not edit lane 4's files.
- [SEPARATE-SLUG #3218] Release records, `valor-improve release compare`'s comparison logic, and the candidate-surface denylist. The CLI ships the `release compare` subcommand as a reader of `ImprovementRelease` rows that prints "no release records yet, written by lane 6" until lane 6 writes them.
- [SEPARATE-SLUG #3274] Moving the unit-3 window counter (`improvement:budget:unit3:{window_key}`) and its Lua into the `improve:*` namespace. Lane 7 shipped it on its own key with paired Popoto ledger rows; moving a live counter mid-window buys a naming consistency and risks a double-count. The counter stays where it is, `valor-improve budget` reads it through `tools.infrastructure_budget.status_dict`, and the sentence in `docs/features/improvement-controller.md` that promised the migration is corrected in this lane's docs task.
- [DESTRUCTIVE] Lifting or bypassing the child session gate. The research path never passes `parent_agent_session_id` and never sets `VALOR_ALLOW_CHILD_SESSIONS`; the "no child-gate bypass" Verification row asserts it.
- [DESTRUCTIVE] Rerouting `tools/cross_vendor_judge.py` to OpenRouter (`base_url`). That is a provider change for a review-quality judge, not a metering change. The judge gains a record-only meter call (receipt with `purpose="sdlc_review"`, `metering="estimated"`) and keeps its provider.
- [EXTERNAL] Provisioning the `valor-local` service account's write access to `m-valor`. `tools/vault_write.py` fails closed with a `VaultWriteRefused` result when `op item create` is refused, and the probe row reports it.

## Update System

- `scripts/update/run.py` gains a `register_improvement_intent_reconcile` step calling the new `reflection_register.py::register_improvement_intent_reconcile` (`cadence="300s"`, callable `reflections.improvement_intent_reconcile.run_improvement_intent_reconcile`), idempotent like `register_improvement_collect` (`scripts/update/reflection_register.py:625`), machine-pinned by the existing `_this_machine_owns_valor` guard. The `RegisterResult` field joins the run.py result dataclass beside the collect step's.
- `pyproject.toml [project.scripts]` gains `valor-improve = "tools.improvement:main"`. `/update` already reinstalls the project (`uv sync`), so the console script materializes on the next update with no further step.
- No new third-party dependencies. `openai` (already pinned) is the only client the meter touches, and only through the response object a caller hands it.
- No `.env` change. `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` is already declared with `# @passthrough op`; `tools/vault_write.py` reads it from the process environment exactly as `tools/improvement_resources.py` does.
- No Popoto schema change and no migration. `admitted` is a status value, `resource_acquired` is a constant, session provenance rides `AgentSession.extra_context`, and every new record lives in the non-Popoto `improve:*` namespace. `scripts/update/migrations.py` is untouched, which also keeps this lane out of lane 4's edit to that file.

## Agent Integration

- New CLI entry point `valor-improve = "tools.improvement:main"` in `pyproject.toml [project.scripts]`, subcommands `case show`, `case explain`, `propose`, `propose-amendment`, `budget`, `release compare`, `pause`, `resume`, `doctor`, `export`, `import`, `replay-projection`. A research session reaches research state only through `propose`, which acquires the case lease, writes one `action_proposed` journal event under journal authorization, and never exposes a raw transition. `--json` on every subcommand for the agent; the human format is the default.
- The research skill `.claude/skills/improve-research/SKILL.md` (project-only, never synced) instructs the session to read the bounded brief it was given, use `WebSearch`/`WebFetch`, write hypotheses and proposed actions through `valor-improve propose`, never run `valor-session create`, never send a message, and never ask a human anything. The one outbound message class is `valor-improve propose-amendment`, which sends Tom one plain Telegram message through `reflections/utilities.py::send_eng_telegram` and leaves the investigation `awaiting_authorization`.
- The bridge imports nothing new; the poll registry, `tools/ask_poll.py`, `bridge/poll_registry.py`, and `bridge/answer_routing.py` are untouched.
- `models/session_lifecycle.py::finalize_session` gains one lazy-imported, exception-isolated call into `tools.improvement_control.intents.on_session_terminal(session, status)`, gated on the session carrying `action_id` provenance, so a research session's lane slot is released on every termination path.
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_improvement_control_cli.py` runs `valor-improve propose` end to end against a claimed test db and asserts the journal shows the event; a session on the research path attempting `valor-session create --parent` receives `ChildSessionsDisabledError`'s message; `valor-improve doctor` on a seeded paused case prints the paused head and its outstanding reservation.

## Documentation

- [ ] Update `docs/features/improvement-controller.md`: replace the "lane 3" placeholders in "Control namespace contract", "Dispatch", "Break-glass", and "Dependency on #3183" with the shipped shapes (key layout, reason codes, intent lifecycle, the lease protocol and its #3220 hand-off, unit-2 metering, the vault writer), and correct the unit-3 sentence at `:224-225` to the recorded decision (the counter stays on its key).
- [ ] Update `docs/features/session-recovery-mechanisms.md`: add `admitted` to the status inventory with its owner (`reflection`, the `improvement-intent-reconcile` pass), state that the health check, startup recovery, and the resume drip never touch it, and describe the reconcile pass as mechanism 8 in the same table shape.
- [ ] Update `docs/tools-reference.md`: the `valor-improve` section drops "planned" and lists the shipped subcommands with `--json`.
- [ ] Update `docs/features/adding-reflection-tasks.md` (or its registration section) with the second improvement registration, `improvement-intent-reconcile`.
- [ ] Update `docs/features/redis-models.md`: the `improve:*` namespace exception and its private-alias rule, cross-linked to the feature doc.
- [ ] Create `.claude/skills/improve-research/SKILL.md` (project-only skill text is documentation the agent reads).
- [ ] Add a lane-3 section to `docs/plans/critiques/recursive-self-improvement-capability-matrix.md`.
