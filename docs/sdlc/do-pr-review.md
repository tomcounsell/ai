## Documentation Gate

Every PR must have a corresponding `docs/features/{slug}.md` if the plan's `## Documentation` section specified one. Verify this file exists before approving. Missing docs are a blocker.

## Plan Section Compliance

Verify the plan included all four required sections (validated by hooks):
- `## Documentation` — has checkbox tasks with `docs/features/` paths
- `## Update System` — addresses `migrations.py` for Popoto changes
- `## Agent Integration` — addresses MCP exposure for new Python tools
- `## Test Impact` — lists affected tests with UPDATE/DELETE/REPLACE

If the PR was built from a plan missing any section, flag it as a blocker.

## Ruff and Test Gates

A PR must not merge with:
- `ruff check .` failures (exit non-zero)
- `ruff format --check .` failures
- Failing unit tests

These are hard gates. No exceptions.

## Multi-Machine Compatibility

If the PR adds new environment variables, verify they are in `.env.example` and `config/settings.py`. If the PR adds new migrations, verify they are registered in `MIGRATIONS` in `scripts/update/migrations.py`.

## Bridge/Worker Changes

If the PR modifies `bridge/`, `agent/`, or `worker/`, flag for restart-after-deploy. The reviewer should note whether the change requires a service restart on all machines.

## UI Screenshots

For any PR that touches `ui/`, include before/after screenshots taken via `agent-browser` or `bowser`. Screenshots must show the actual running app at `localhost:8500`, not mockups.
