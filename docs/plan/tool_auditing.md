# PydanticAI Tool Auditing Guide

This document outlines the comprehensive process for auditing PydanticAI tools to ensure they meet production quality standards, maintain clear separation of concerns, and provide reliable functionality within the agent ecosystem.

## Overview

A tool audit validates that a PydanticAI tool is well-designed, thoroughly tested, properly documented, and follows established architectural patterns. The audit process ensures tools are maintainable, reliable, and provide clear value to both the agent and human developers.

## Prerequisites & Design Principles

### Tom's Minimal Design Requirements

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - Tool function handles only the core logic for its specific purpose
   - External service integration is abstracted through dedicated modules
   - Business logic is separated from I/O operations
   - Error handling is consistent and appropriate for the tool's scope

2. **Single Responsibility**
   - Each tool does one thing well
   - Tool purpose is clearly defined and limited in scope
   - Dependencies are minimal and well-justified

3. **Predictable Interface**
   - Input parameters are typed and validated
   - Output format is consistent and documented
   - Error conditions are well-defined and handled gracefully

## Audit Process Overview

The audit follows a structured approach across four main phases:

1. **Design Review** - Architecture and separation of concerns
2. **Implementation Review** - Code quality and best practices
3. **Testing Validation** - End-to-end functionality coverage
4. **Documentation Review** - Clarity for both agents and developers

## Phase 1: Design Review

### 1.1 Architectural Assessment

**Objective**: Validate the tool follows proper separation of concerns and architectural patterns.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Tool has a single, well-defined responsibility
- [ ] External service calls are abstracted through dedicated modules (e.g., `tools/search_tool.py` uses `search_web()`)
- [ ] Business logic is separated from I/O operations
- [ ] Dependencies are minimal and justified
- [ ] Tool doesn't duplicate functionality of existing tools

**Questions to Answer**:
- What specific problem does this tool solve for the agent?
- How does this tool fit into the overall agent capability matrix?
- Are there any architectural red flags (tight coupling, circular dependencies, etc.)?

### 1.2 Interface Design

**Objective**: Ensure the tool interface is clean, typed, and predictable.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Function signature uses proper Python type hints
- [ ] Parameters are logically organized and named
- [ ] Optional parameters have sensible defaults
- [ ] Return type is consistent and documented
- [ ] Context parameter (`RunContext[ValorContext]`) is used appropriately

**Example of Good Interface Design**:
```python
@valor_agent.tool
def search_current_info(ctx: RunContext[ValorContext], query: str) -> str:
    """Search for current information on the web using Perplexity AI."""
```

## Phase 2: Implementation Review

### 2.1 Code Quality Assessment

**Objective**: Validate implementation follows Python best practices and PydanticAI patterns.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Code follows PEP 8 style guidelines
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive and graceful
- [ ] Edge cases are properly handled
- [ ] Performance considerations are addressed
- [ ] Security considerations are implemented (input validation, safe API calls)
- [ ] Logging is appropriate and helpful for debugging

### 2.2 PydanticAI Integration

**Objective**: Ensure proper integration with the PydanticAI framework.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Tool is properly decorated with `@agent.tool`
- [ ] Context is used appropriately (accessing chat_id, username, etc.)
- [ ] Tool doesn't cause hanging or blocking issues
- [ ] Tool integrates well with other agent tools
- [ ] Return values are agent-friendly (formatted for conversation)

**Best Practices Reference**:
- Follow [PydanticAI Tool Documentation](https://ai.pydantic.dev/tools/)
- Use context for chat-specific functionality
- Format outputs for conversational use
- Handle async operations properly if needed

### 2.3 Dependency Management

**Objective**: Validate external dependencies are properly managed.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] External API keys are properly configured via environment variables
- [ ] API rate limits are respected
- [ ] Network timeouts are configured appropriately
- [ ] Fallback behavior is implemented for service failures
- [ ] Dependencies are documented in requirements

## Phase 3: Testing Validation

### 3.1 End-to-End Functionality Testing

**Objective**: Ensure the tool works correctly in all expected scenarios without prescribing specific testing methods.

**Core Testing Areas** (methodology flexible):
- **Happy Path Testing**: Tool performs its primary function correctly
- **Error Condition Testing**: Tool handles failures gracefully
- **Edge Case Testing**: Tool behaves correctly with unusual inputs
- **Integration Testing**: Tool works within the agent ecosystem
- **Performance Testing**: Tool performs within acceptable time limits

**Testing Approaches** (choose what fits):
- Unit tests for core logic
- Integration tests with live services
- Mock tests for external dependencies
- Manual testing scenarios
- Automated test suites

### 3.2 Agent Integration Testing

**Objective**: Validate the tool works correctly when called by the agent.

**Test Scenarios**:
- Agent correctly selects tool for appropriate queries
- Tool provides useful responses in conversational context
- Tool doesn't interfere with other agent capabilities
- Tool handles context information appropriately
- Error messages are user-friendly

### 3.3 Regression Testing

**Objective**: Ensure tool changes don't break existing functionality.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Existing test cases still pass
- [ ] Tool behavior remains consistent for known inputs
- [ ] Performance hasn't degraded significantly
- [ ] Integration with other tools remains stable

## Phase 4: Documentation Review

### 4.1 Agent-Facing Documentation

**Objective**: Ensure the agent can understand when and how to use the tool.

**Requirements**:
- **Clear Tool Description**: Explains what the tool does in plain language
- **Usage Examples**: Shows when the tool should be used
- **Parameter Descriptions**: Explains each parameter's purpose
- **Return Value Description**: Explains what the tool returns

**Example of Good Agent Documentation**:
```python
def search_current_info(ctx: RunContext[ValorContext], query: str) -> str:
    """Search for current information on the web using Perplexity AI.

    This tool enables the Valor agent to access up-to-date information from
    the web when answering questions about current events, trends, or recent
    developments that may not be in the agent's training data.

    Use this when you need up-to-date information about:
    - Current events, news, or recent developments
    - Latest technology trends or releases
    - Current market conditions or company information
    - Recent research or publications
    - Any information that might have changed recently

    Args:
        ctx: The runtime context containing conversation information.
        query: The search query to find current information about.

    Returns:
        str: Current information from web search formatted for conversation.

    Example:
        >>> search_current_info(ctx, "Python 3.12 new features")
        'üîç **Python 3.12 new features**\n\nPython 3.12 includes...'
    """
```

### 4.2 Developer-Facing Documentation

**Objective**: Ensure developers can understand, maintain, and extend the tool.

**Requirements**:
- **Architecture Documentation**: Explains how the tool fits into the system
- **Implementation Details**: Covers important design decisions
- **Maintenance Notes**: Explains common maintenance tasks
- **Extension Guidelines**: Shows how to safely extend functionality
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions

### 4.3 Integration Documentation

**Objective**: Document how the tool integrates with external services and the broader system.

**Requirements**:
- **External Dependencies**: Document required API keys, services, etc.
- **Configuration Requirements**: Environment variables, settings, etc.
- **Service Limitations**: Rate limits, quotas, availability considerations
- **Error Scenarios**: Common failure modes and how they're handled
