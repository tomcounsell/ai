# PydanticAI Tool Auditing Guide

This document outlines the comprehensive process for auditing PydanticAI tools to ensure they meet production quality standards, maintain clear separation of concerns, and provide reliable functionality within the agent ecosystem.

**🚨 URGENT UPDATE**: [Comprehensive Tool Analysis](../../comprehensive_tool_analysis.md) reveals massive tool duplication across all 3 layers. All audits must now include **Duplication Assessment** phase.

## Overview

A tool audit validates that a PydanticAI tool is well-designed, thoroughly tested, properly documented, and follows established architectural patterns. The audit process ensures tools are maintainable, reliable, and provide clear value to both the agent and human developers.

## Prerequisites & Design Principles

### Tom's Minimal Design Requirements

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - Tool function handles only the core logic for its specific purpose
   - External service integration is abstracted through dedicated modules
   - Business logic is separated from I/O operations
   - Error handling is consistent and appropriate for the tool's scope

2. **Single Responsibility**
   - Each tool does one thing well
   - Tool purpose is clearly defined and limited in scope
   - Dependencies are minimal and well-justified

3. **Predictable Interface**
   - Input parameters are typed and validated
   - Output format is consistent and documented
   - Error conditions are well-defined and handled gracefully

## Audit Process Overview

The audit follows a structured approach across five main phases:

1. **Duplication Assessment** - Identify cross-layer duplications and consolidation opportunities
2. **Design Review** - Architecture and separation of concerns
3. **Implementation Review** - Code quality and best practices
4. **Testing Validation** - End-to-end functionality coverage
5. **Documentation Review** - Clarity for both agents and developers

## Phase 1: Duplication Assessment

**🚨 CRITICAL PHASE**: Due to architecture crisis, this phase is now MANDATORY for all tool audits.

### 1.1 Cross-Layer Duplication Check

**Objective**: Identify if the tool being audited exists in multiple layers with the same functionality.

**Duplication Mapping Process**:
1. **Check Agent Layer**: Search `agents/valor/agent.py` for `@valor_agent.tool` with similar functionality
2. **Check MCP Layer**: Search all `mcp_servers/*.py` files for `@mcp.tool` with similar functionality  
3. **Check Standalone Layer**: Search `tools/` directory for similar implementation files
4. **Document findings**: Record all duplications found

**Duplication Categories**:
- 🔴 **Full Duplication**: Identical functionality across 3 layers (Agent + MCP + Standalone)
- 🟡 **Partial Duplication**: Similar functionality with different feature sets
- 🟢 **Unique Tool**: Exists only in current layer

**Critical Questions to Answer**:
- Does this tool duplicate functionality in other layers?
- Which implementation is the most comprehensive/maintained?
- What are the API differences between implementations?
- Which layer should be the "source of truth" for this functionality?

### 1.2 Consolidation Planning

**For Full Duplications (🔴)**:
- **MANDATORY**: Mark tool for consolidation in audit report
- **Recommend**: Keep MCP implementation as primary (Claude Code integration)
- **Plan**: Deprecation strategy for Agent/Standalone duplicates
- **Document**: Migration path for current users

**For Partial Duplications (🟡)**:
- **Analyze**: Feature differences between implementations
- **Recommend**: Consolidation strategy (merge features into one layer)
- **Plan**: Feature migration or tool specialization

**For Unique Tools (🟢)**:
- **Validate**: Tool provides unique value not available elsewhere
- **Document**: Why this tool needs to exist separately
- **Consider**: Whether functionality should be moved to MCP layer

### 1.3 Architecture Impact Assessment

**Questions to Address**:
- How does this duplication affect maintenance overhead?
- What is the cost of keeping multiple implementations?
- Are there inconsistencies between implementations that confuse users?
- What would be the impact of consolidating this tool?

## Phase 2: Design Review

### 1.1 Architectural Assessment

**Objective**: Validate the tool follows proper separation of concerns and architectural patterns.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Tool has a single, well-defined responsibility
- [ ] External service calls are abstracted through dedicated modules (e.g., `tools/search_tool.py` uses `search_web()`)
- [ ] Business logic is separated from I/O operations
- [ ] Dependencies are minimal and justified
- [ ] Tool doesn't duplicate functionality of existing tools

**Questions to Answer**:
- What specific problem does this tool solve for the agent?
- How does this tool fit into the overall agent capability matrix?
- Are there any architectural red flags (tight coupling, circular dependencies, etc.)?

### 1.2 Interface Design

**Objective**: Ensure the tool interface is clean, typed, and predictable.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Function signature uses proper Python type hints
- [ ] Parameters are logically organized and named
- [ ] Optional parameters have sensible defaults
- [ ] Return type is consistent and documented
- [ ] Context parameter (`RunContext[ValorContext]`) is used appropriately

**Example of Good Interface Design**:
```python
@valor_agent.tool
def search_current_info(ctx: RunContext[ValorContext], query: str) -> str:
    """Search for current information on the web using Perplexity AI."""
```

## Phase 2: Implementation Review

### 2.1 Code Quality Assessment

**Objective**: Validate implementation follows Python best practices and PydanticAI patterns.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Code follows PEP 8 style guidelines
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive and graceful
- [ ] Edge cases are properly handled
- [ ] Performance considerations are addressed
- [ ] Security considerations are implemented (input validation, safe API calls)
- [ ] Logging is appropriate and helpful for debugging

### 2.2 PydanticAI Integration

**Objective**: Ensure proper integration with the PydanticAI framework.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Tool is properly decorated with `@agent.tool`
- [ ] Context is used appropriately (accessing chat_id, username, etc.)
- [ ] Tool doesn't cause hanging or blocking issues
- [ ] Tool integrates well with other agent tools
- [ ] Return values are agent-friendly (formatted for conversation)

**Best Practices Reference**:
- Follow [PydanticAI Tool Documentation](https://ai.pydantic.dev/tools/)
- Use context for chat-specific functionality
- Format outputs for conversational use
- Handle async operations properly if needed

### 2.3 Dependency Management

**Objective**: Validate external dependencies are properly managed.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] External API keys are properly configured via environment variables
- [ ] API rate limits are respected
- [ ] Network timeouts are configured appropriately
- [ ] Fallback behavior is implemented for service failures
- [ ] Dependencies are documented in requirements

## Phase 3: Testing Validation

### 3.1 End-to-End Functionality Testing

**Objective**: Ensure the tool works correctly in all expected scenarios without prescribing specific testing methods.

**Core Testing Areas** (methodology flexible):
- **Happy Path Testing**: Tool performs its primary function correctly
- **Error Condition Testing**: Tool handles failures gracefully
- **Edge Case Testing**: Tool behaves correctly with unusual inputs
- **Integration Testing**: Tool works within the agent ecosystem
- **Performance Testing**: Tool performs within acceptable time limits

**Testing Approaches** (prioritized by effectiveness):
1. **Real Integration Tests**: Use actual database, file system, and internal services
2. **Minimal External Mocking**: Only mock external API calls (Perplexity, OpenAI, etc.)
3. **Unit Tests for Utilities**: Test isolated functions with real implementations
4. **Manual Testing Scenarios**: End-to-end validation with actual usage
5. **Automated Test Suites**: Comprehensive coverage with fast execution

**Testing Philosophy**: 
- **Mock only when absolutely necessary** - external APIs and services outside our control
- **Use real implementations** for databases, file operations, and internal logic
- **Test the actual code paths** that will run in production
- **Validate integration points** with real data and real database operations

### 3.2 Agent Integration Testing

**Objective**: Validate the tool works correctly when called by the agent.

**Test Scenarios**:
- Agent correctly selects tool for appropriate queries
- Tool provides useful responses in conversational context
- Tool doesn't interfere with other agent capabilities
- Tool handles context information appropriately
- Error messages are user-friendly
- **No hanging or blocking issues** during tool execution
- **Context parameter handling** works with mock RunContext objects

**Testing Approach for Agent Tools**:
```python
# Use lightweight mock only for RunContext - everything else should be real
from unittest.mock import MagicMock

def test_agent_tool_integration():
    """Test agent tool with minimal mocking."""
    # Only mock the RunContext - use real implementations for everything else
    mock_ctx = MagicMock()
    mock_ctx.deps.chat_id = 12345
    mock_ctx.deps.username = "test_user"
    
    # Test calls real database, real file operations, real business logic
    result = agent_tool_function(mock_ctx, "test input")
    
    # Verify results using real database queries
    assert "expected content" in result
```

**What to Mock vs. What to Keep Real**:
- ✅ **Mock**: External APIs (OpenAI, Perplexity), RunContext for agent tools
- ✅ **Keep Real**: Databases, file operations, internal business logic, utility functions
- ✅ **Keep Real**: Error handling, validation, formatting, data processing

### 3.3 Regression Testing

**Objective**: Ensure tool changes don't break existing functionality.

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Existing test cases still pass
- [ ] Tool behavior remains consistent for known inputs
- [ ] Performance hasn't degraded significantly
- [ ] Integration with other tools remains stable

## Phase 4: Documentation Review

### 4.1 Agent-Facing Documentation

**Objective**: Ensure the agent can understand when and how to use the tool.

**Requirements**:
- **Clear Tool Description**: Explains what the tool does in plain language
- **Usage Examples**: Shows when the tool should be used
- **Parameter Descriptions**: Explains each parameter's purpose
- **Return Value Description**: Explains what the tool returns

**Example of Good Agent Documentation**:
```python
def search_current_info(ctx: RunContext[ValorContext], query: str) -> str:
    """Search for current information on the web using Perplexity AI.

    This tool enables the Valor agent to access up-to-date information from
    the web when answering questions about current events, trends, or recent
    developments that may not be in the agent's training data.

    Use this when you need up-to-date information about:
    - Current events, news, or recent developments
    - Latest technology trends or releases
    - Current market conditions or company information
    - Recent research or publications
    - Any information that might have changed recently

    Args:
        ctx: The runtime context containing conversation information.
        query: The search query to find current information about.

    Returns:
        str: Current information from web search formatted for conversation.

    Example:
        >>> search_current_info(ctx, "Python 3.12 new features")
        '🔍 **Python 3.12 new features**\n\nPython 3.12 includes...'
    """
```

### 4.2 Developer-Facing Documentation

**Objective**: Ensure developers can understand, maintain, and extend the tool.

**Requirements**:
- **Architecture Documentation**: Explains how the tool fits into the system
- **Implementation Details**: Covers important design decisions
- **Maintenance Notes**: Explains common maintenance tasks
- **Extension Guidelines**: Shows how to safely extend functionality
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions

### 4.3 Integration Documentation

**Objective**: Document how the tool integrates with external services and the broader system.

**Requirements**:

## Best Practices Summary

### Tool Design
- Keep tools focused on a single responsibility
- Use clear, descriptive parameter names
- Provide sensible defaults for optional parameters
- Return conversation-friendly formatted strings
- **Avoid subprocess spawning** that can cause hanging issues

### Implementation
- Follow Python type hints throughout
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Use appropriate logging for debugging
- Validate inputs and sanitize outputs
- **Test for hanging/blocking issues** especially with external processes

### Testing
- **Use real implementations wherever possible** - databases, file operations, business logic
- **Mock only external APIs** - OpenAI, Perplexity, and services outside our control
- **Mock lightweight interfaces** - RunContext for agent integration tests
- Test both happy path and error conditions with real data flows
- Include integration testing with actual database operations
- Test with realistic data and scenarios using production-like setup
- Validate performance under load with real systems
- **Add specific tests for recently fixed issues** to prevent regressions

### Testing Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ **Over-mocking**: Don't mock database connections, file operations, or internal logic
- ❌ **Complex mock setups**: If your mock setup is complicated, use the real thing instead
- ❌ **Mocking what you own**: Mock external services, not your own code
- ❌ **Mock-heavy tests**: Tests with more mock setup than actual testing are red flags

### Documentation
- Write for both agent and human audiences
- Include clear examples and use cases
- Document all configuration requirements
- Explain error conditions and handling
- **Document architectural decisions** especially for recent fixes
- **Update docstrings immediately** when implementation changes

### Recent Audit Lessons (save_link_for_later - December 2024)

**Key Learning: Mock Only When Absolutely Necessary**

During the `save_link_for_later` audit, we discovered that excessive mocking made tests fragile and didn't validate real functionality:

**What Worked Well:**
- ✅ **Mocking only external APIs** (Perplexity) while using real database operations
- ✅ **Testing with actual SQLite database** to validate storage and retrieval
- ✅ **Using real utility functions** to test URL extraction and validation
- ✅ **Lightweight RunContext mocking** for agent integration tests

**What We Avoided:**
- ❌ Complex database connection mocking that didn't test real behavior
- ❌ Over-engineered context manager mocking that obscured actual issues
- ❌ Mocking internal business logic that needed real validation

**Testing Pattern That Emerged:**
```python
@patch('tools.link_analysis_tool.analyze_url_content')  # External API only
def test_store_link_with_analysis_success(self, mock_analyze):
    # Mock external API response
    mock_analyze.return_value = {'title': 'Test', 'main_topic': 'Testing'}
    
    # Use real database, real validation, real business logic
    result = store_link_with_analysis("https://example.com")
    self.assertTrue(result)
    
    # Verify with real database query
    search_result = search_stored_links("example.com")
    self.assertIn("Test", search_result)
```

**Result**: 15/15 tests passing with confidence that real functionality works correctly.

### Historical Audit Lessons
- **Check git history first** for recently fixed tools to understand context
- **Update documentation immediately** when behavior changes
- **Create comprehensive tests** for new functionality
- **Use TodoWrite tool** to track audit progress
- **Commit and push improvements** to preserve audit work

## Deliverable Workflow

### During Audit
1. **Create audit workspace**: `mkdir docs/audits/[tool_name]/`
2. **Generate recommendations file**: `docs/audits/[tool_name]_recommendations.md`
3. **Document findings**: `docs/audits/[tool_name]_audit_report.md`
4. **Track progress**: Update TODO.md with specific action items

### Post-Audit Implementation
1. **Work through recommendations**: Use recommendations.md as working TODO list
2. **Update codebase**: Implement critical and high-priority improvements
3. **Enhance documentation**: Update tool docstrings and add developer notes
4. **Add/improve tests**: Address testing gaps identified in audit
5. **Validate changes**: Re-run audit phases to ensure improvements

### Completion
1. **Final report**: Update audit report with "Approved" status
2. **Cleanup**: Delete temporary recommendations.md file
3. **Update TODO.md**: Mark tool as ✅ Approved in main TODO list
4. **Commit and push**: Ensure all improvements are preserved in git
5. **Optional archiving**: Move audit report to `docs/audits/completed/` for organization

## Special Audit Considerations

### Recently Fixed Tools
Tools marked as "recently fixed" in TODO.md require extra attention:

1. **Validate the fix** - Understand what was broken and how it was fixed
2. **Test the fix thoroughly** - Ensure the issue is completely resolved
3. **Update documentation** - Reflect any behavioral changes
4. **Add regression tests** - Prevent the issue from recurring
5. **Document architectural decisions** - Explain why the fix was implemented that way

**Example**: delegate_coding_task was fixed to prevent hanging by returning guidance instead of spawning subprocesses. The audit must validate this approach works and update documentation accordingly.

### Tool Pairs (Agent + Implementation)
Some tools have both an agent wrapper and implementation file:
- **Agent tool**: Focus on PydanticAI integration, context usage, conversation formatting
- **Implementation**: Focus on core logic, external APIs, error handling
- **Audit both together** when they're closely related
- **Ensure consistency** between agent interface and implementation behavior

### External API Tools
Tools that integrate with external services need special consideration:
- **API key validation** - Proper environment variable handling
- **Rate limiting** - Respect service limits, implement delays
- **Timeout handling** - Prevent hanging on slow/unresponsive APIs
- **Fallback behavior** - Graceful degradation when services unavailable
- **Error mapping** - Convert API errors to user-friendly messages

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Before Major Tool Changes
- Review existing audit report for guidance
- Update recommendations if new issues identified
- Ensure changes align with architectural principles

### After Tool Improvements
- Run quick re-audit to validate improvements
- Update documentation to reflect changes
- Add regression tests for fixed issues

### Continuous Improvement
- Schedule periodic re-audits for critical tools
- Use audit findings to improve overall tool patterns
- Share best practices across tool development

### Audit Workflow Integration
- **Use TodoWrite tool** to track audit progress and implementation tasks
- **Commit frequently** during implementation to preserve incremental progress
- **Push final results** to ensure audit work is preserved
- **Update TODO.md immediately** when tools are approved

## Conclusion

A thorough tool audit ensures that PydanticAI tools are reliable, maintainable, and provide clear value to the agent ecosystem. By following this structured approach, teams can maintain high quality standards while enabling rapid development and deployment of new agent capabilities.

The audit process is designed to be comprehensive yet flexible, allowing teams to adapt the methodology to their specific needs while ensuring all critical quality dimensions are evaluated. The deliverable structure ensures that audit findings translate directly into actionable improvements that enhance tool quality and developer productivity.
