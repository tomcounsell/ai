### Multi-Persona Collaboration Framework

#### Advanced Collaboration Patterns

**Sequential Workflows**:
```python
async def sequential_persona_workflow(problem: str) -> str:
    # H.G. Wells provides strategic framework
    strategic_analysis = await hg_wells_agent.run(...)

    # Valor Engels handles technical implementation
    technical_solution = await valor_agent.run(...)

    # TechnicalAdvisor reviews and optimizes
    review_feedback = await technical_advisor_agent.run(...)

    return integrate_persona_responses([strategic_analysis, technical_solution, review_feedback])
```

**Parallel Collaboration**:
```python
async def parallel_persona_workflow(problem: str) -> str:
    tasks = [
        hg_wells_agent.run(f"Strategic analysis: {problem}"),
        valor_agent.run(f"Technical analysis: {problem}"),
        technical_advisor_agent.run(f"Architecture review: {problem}"),
        # Project context now handled through pm_tools MCP server
        valor_agent.run_with_tools(f"Project context analysis: {problem}")
    ]

    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return synthesize_parallel_responses(results)
```

**Debate and Consultation Modes**:
- Personas present different viewpoints
- Cross-persona questioning and refinement
- Consensus building through iteration

#### Persona Communication Protocols

**Inter-Persona Messaging**:
```python
class PersonaMessage(BaseModel):
    from_persona: str
    to_persona: str
    message_type: str  # "request", "response", "insight", "question"
    content: str
    context: dict = {}
```

```python
@agent.tool
def multi_step_analysis(ctx: RunContext[ContextType], problem: str) -> str:
    # Step 1: Web search for current information
    current_info = search_web(f"latest information about {problem}")

    # Step 2: Claude Code for implementation
    implementation = spawn_claude_session(
        f"Implement solution for {problem}",
        target_directory="/project/path"
    )

    # Step 3: Notion integration for project context
    project_context = query_notion_database(f"related projects: {problem}")

    return synthesize_multi_tool_response(current_info, implementation, project_context)
```

#### Smart Tool Selection

**Context-Aware Tool Usage**:
```python
@agent.tool
def adaptive_tool(ctx: RunContext[ContextType], query: str) -> str:
    if ctx.deps.is_priority_question:
        return detailed_analysis_with_notion(query)
    elif ctx.deps.requires_current_info:
        return web_search_analysis(query)
    elif ctx.deps.needs_implementation:
        return claude_code_delegation(query)
    else:
        return quick_response(query)
```

## User Experience Enhancements

### Seamless Multi-Persona Interactions

**Integrated Response Formatting**:
```python
def format_multi_persona_response(responses: dict) -> str:
    formatted_response = "## Collaborative Analysis\n\n"

    for persona_name, response in responses.items():
        persona_icon = get_persona_icon(persona_name)
        formatted_response += f"### {persona_icon} {persona_name}\n"
        formatted_response += f"{response.content}\n\n"

    formatted_response += "### ðŸ”„ Integrated Recommendation\n"
    formatted_response += synthesize_recommendations(responses)

    return formatted_response

       recovery_action = auto_recovery.determine_action(error_context)
       
       if recovery_action == RecoveryAction.AUTO_FIX:
           await auto_recovery.attempt_immediate_fix(error_context)
           return "ðŸ”§ I found and fixed a bug. Please try again!"
       elif recovery_action == RecoveryAction.CREATE_PROMISE:
