add another feature to both - that is claude code session ids                                                                                                                                                 â”‚

â”‚   I'd like to capture the session id, remembering it between messages in the chat. so when a followup question comes through (or confirmation to build something proposed after a previous analysis tool result) we can pick up where left off and complete more work in the same context sessions.
Think about how we can implement this feature in our system, using the sqlite database as a temporary store.
